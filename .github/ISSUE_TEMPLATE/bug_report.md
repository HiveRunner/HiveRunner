<!-- 
 Before raising a bug report please consider the following:
   1. If you want to ask a question don't raise a bug report - rather use the mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hive-runner-user
   2. Please ensure that the bug your are reporting is actually in HiveRunner and not with Hive itself. Because HiveRunner tests Hive queries, if there 
      are issues with your queries or Hive setup, it will just return any errors that Hive itself throws and users sometimes mistakenly report these
      as HiveRunner issues. The easiest way to check this is to perform your query against Hive directly. If the issue still persists then it's not 
      related to HiveRunner so please don't report it here.
